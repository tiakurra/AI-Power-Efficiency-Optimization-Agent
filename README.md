# AI-Power-Efficiency-Optimization-Agent
This project is an AI powered dashboard that analyzes device level power usage and provides ways to optimize energy. It uses simulated IoT sensor data to track power consumption over time, applies statistical reasoning and regression modeling to predict power spikes, and visualizes patterns.
The dashboard allows users to generate new power datasets directly within the app or automatically loads the latest data from the data folder. It calculates key statistics such as average and maximum power, provides an efficiency score, and offers recommendations based on the observed trends.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required Python packages from requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app
4. In the dashboard, you can:
 - View the latest power dataset loaded automatically from the data folder.
 - Click "Generate New Power Data" to create fresh simulated data.
